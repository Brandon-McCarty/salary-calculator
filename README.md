## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

This project takes user input of employee data and then stores the data and displays the input on the page. A real-time calculation is completed of all input employee salaries which is then displayed at the bottom of the page. Each employee data display is given an option to be removed from the display and the salary calculation is then updated to account for the removed salary value.

Storing Employee data: The user input value is grabbed and then stored in an employee object which is then put into an array.

Salary calculation: The employee salaries are added to a global variable as each new employee is added. The total is then adjusted when an employee is added or removed.
